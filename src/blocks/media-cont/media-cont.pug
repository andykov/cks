          p If I struggle a lifetime, What would my body be? An empty shell, On what a demon fed Could be a heavy burden, To stay true to your words Speak up, I wanna silence everything If I got no plan, Doesn’t mean that I get what I want for free If I got no meaning, Would you force me to a place where I make sense? ‘Cause nothing lasts forever How do I get home? Everything revolves around you If I can’t find myself? As you’re so completely fake How do I get home? Everything revolves around you If even you can’t help? Dark night’s from my soul I deny failure, I ignite Woe is on my misery, She wins all their eyes Realise what they find’s not fate, This is not me, this is me So if I struggle a lifetime, What good would that do? If I got a plan, Doesn’t have to stop the feeling inside If I do make sense, Would you drag me down? ‘Cause nothing lasts forever How do I get home? Everything revolves around you! If I can’t find myself? As you’re so completely fake! How do I get home? Everything revolves around you! If even you can’t help? Dark night from my soul
